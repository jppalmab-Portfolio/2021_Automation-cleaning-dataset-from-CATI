`[Python | Regex | Programming]`

Welcome to the "Automating Cleaning of CATI Datasets" repository! This project showcases the development of an automation task program in Python, utilizing regular expressions (Regex) and programming techniques. The primary objective was to automate the cleaning process of databases obtained from Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) systems. The solution focuses on standardizing the ID key for joining data frames, leading to significant time savings by reducing weeks of human work per project to just a minute.

**Abstract:**

In this project, I have developed a robust automation task program in Python to address the challenges associated with cleaning databases obtained from Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) systems. CATI systems generate vast amounts of data, but inconsistencies in the ID key across datasets often hinder the integration and analysis process. By leveraging regular expressions (Regex) and programming techniques, this solution automates the standardization of the ID key, resulting in clean and unified data frames.
